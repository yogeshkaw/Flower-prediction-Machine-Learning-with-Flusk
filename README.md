# Flower-prediction-Machine-Learning-with-Flusk
The main aim of this project is to show or demonstrate the deployment of Machine Learning model using Flusk API

In the templates folder we have created two basic web pages for input and output
If you remainber in the "iris-dataset" we have created the pickle file. If not no problem go and check it form the given link https://github.com/yogeshkaw/iris-dataset
we'll put that pickle file in Flower-prediction-Machine-Learning-with-Flusk folder
after that we will create app.py file that will link this pickle file and html pages

run app.py
